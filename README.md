# University-Projects
In this repository you can find the various projects I completed related to my university coursework
The only project which I have uploaded until now is an ACCOUNTING group project for which
we had to work with a company's statement of financial position. I was in charge of analysing various aspects of 
the company's performance using financial analysis ratios. I believed while doing this that coding it with Python would be
the most efficient way of evaluating the performance as I could assign the various values from the cash flow statement to 
variables. This enabled me to amend them upon concertation with my team mates in the event of an error, instead of having to
reproduce the whole calculation. 
With this project I believe I have demonstrated an ability to apply Python in various domains, using its powerful numerical
tools to serve other purposes than Data Science and Web Development.
